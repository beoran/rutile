Rutile should become a low level compiled programming language that thas the 
following goals in order of importance:

1) Bootstrap is implemented in Ruby, next step is self-hosted.
2) Compiles to machine code, not an interpreter or a bytecode compiler.
3) Allow low level programmming.
4) Be parsable with a predictive parser, speedy compilation.
5) Be as Rubylike as possible, so it much easier to use than C. 
4) Retargetable. 
6) Support as much Ruby-like high level constructs as is feasible.
7) Type inference for low level primitives.

Rutilec is a compiler for the Rutile programming language.
The Rutile language tries to be as close to Ruby as possible, 
whilst still remaining fully compilable without needing an 
extensive runtime to support it. This means that some Ruby 
semantics will only be supported at compile time, not at run time.

Licence will be the Zlib license.

Of course this project is highly experimental for now. :)

For the time being, it will compile to C.
