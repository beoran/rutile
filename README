Rutile should become a low level compiled programming language that thas the following goals in order of importance:

1) Implemented in Ruby.
3) Allow low level programmming, and speedy compilation to assembly language.
5) Be as Rubylike as possible, and easier to use than C. 
4) Retargetable. 
6) Support as much Ruby-like high level constructs as is feasible.
7) Type inference for low level primitives.


Rutilec is a compiler or the Rutile programming language.
The Rutile language tries to be as close to Ruby as possible, 
whilst still remaining fully compilable without needing an 
extensive runtime to support it. This means that some Ruby 
semantics will only be supported at compile time, not at run time.

Of course this project is highly experimental for now. :)
